/* Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Bezout's Identity
Bézout's identity states that for any positive integer 𝑎 and 𝑏, there exists integers 𝑥 and 𝑦 such that:
[ax+by = GCD(a,b).]

What if we are given integers 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, and we wish to find integers 𝑥 and 𝑦 such that:
[ax+by = c.]

Find the pair (𝑥,𝑦) satisfying this equation with the minimum possible 𝑥≥0 or determine that this is not possible.

Input: The first and only line contains integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 and 𝑐 with 1≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐≤10^9.

Output: Output a pair of space seperated integers 𝑥 and 𝑦 where 𝑥 is the minimum 𝑥≥0 that satisfies 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑦=𝑐.
